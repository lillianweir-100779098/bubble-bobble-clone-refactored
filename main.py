# Check Python version number. sys.version_info gives version as a tuple, e.g. if (3,7,2,'final',0) for version 3.7.2.

# So we have to split the string into a list, using '.' as the character to split on. We convert each element of the
# version number into an integer - but only if the string contains numbers and nothing else, because it's possible for
# a component of the version to contain letters as well as numbers (e.g. '2.0.dev0')
# We're using a Python feature called list comprehension - this is explained in the Bubble Bobble/Cavern chapter.
